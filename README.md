# Audio Visualiser App

This is a web application that allows users to visualise audio data in real-time. The app includes two different visualisations: a line view and a flower view. The user can adjust the resolution, bottom frequency, and top frequency of the visualisations using controls provided within the app.

The app also includes a database operations view, which allows users to interact with a database of elements. The elements can be displayed in a list, and the app provides controls for refreshing the list and adding new elements to the database.

## Features
- Real-time audio visualisations
